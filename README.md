# mp321

Demo:  [mitchhymel.github.io/mp321](https://mitchhymel.github.io/mp321/) 

This is a quick and hackily thrown together site to provide some ffmpeg functionality via a web app.

Current functionality supported:
- Combine multiple audio files into a single mp3
- Combine multiple (or a single) audio files and an image into a video with a static image
